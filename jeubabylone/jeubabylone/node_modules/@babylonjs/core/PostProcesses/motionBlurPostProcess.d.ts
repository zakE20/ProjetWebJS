 * The Motion Blur Post Process which blurs an image based on the objects velocity in scene.

 * As an example, all you have to do is to create the post-process:
 *  var mb = new BABYLON.MotionBlurPostProcess(
 *      'mb', // The name of the effect.
 *      scene, // The scene containing the objects to blur according to their velocity.
 *      1.0, // The required width/height ratio to downsize to before computing the render pass.
 *      camera // The camera to apply the render pass to.
 * );
 * Then, all objects moving, rotating and/or scaling will be blurred depending on the transformation speed.
